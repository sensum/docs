# Introduction

Welcome to the Sensum Emotion AI Toolkit Documentation.

The toolkit consists of **SensumAPI** and two **SensumSDKs** (iOS & Android) that enable you to build services or products which respond to emotional events in real time. The **SensumSDKs** make it easy to synchronously stream and tag biometric & contextual data from different sources such as wearable devices, smartphones and watches.The **SensumAPI** cleanses, aligns and processes the data streams. Our Emotion AI algorithms use machine learning to extract the emotional metrics and key events.
