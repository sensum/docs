# Android SDK

## Service Constants 

These constants can used to construct message bundled that are then relayed to the Emotion AI's service to send and retrieve data.

One example of a call to the service would be to send credentials in order to authorise a user. See <a href = "#submit-credentials-to-service-for-authorisation">"Submit Credentials to service for authorisation"</a> for an example in how these bundles are constructed.

## Example Methods

## Initiate connection to service
 
`private final ServiceConnection mConnection = new ServiceConnection()`

```java
    private final ServiceConnection mConnection = new ServiceConnection() {
        @Override
        public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName name, IBinder binder) {
            mIsBound = true;
            mServiceMessenger = new Messenger(binder);
        }

        @Override
        public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName name) {

        }
    };
```

## Submit Credentials to service for authorisation 

`void submit()`
